## Custom New Tab Page

I don't like the new "New Tab" page in Brave, so I made a new one.
You can add favorite sites and a free api key from NewsAPI.org to show news, too (requires signup). Everything is stored in localStorage in your browser.

It's hosted [here](https://brentk.github.io/newtab/newtab.html) if you'd like to use that, or you can just save it to your computer and hit it there.

PS: You can't set a custom "New Tab" page in Brave, but you can:
1. Add the "Home" button
2. Which allows you to set a cutom Home page
3. Set the "New Tab" page to your home page

Which achieves the same thing. If you're not using Brave I'm sure you can figure it out. You're smart.

That is all.
