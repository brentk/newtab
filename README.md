## Custom New Tab Page

I don't like the new "New Tab" page in Brave, so I made a new one.
You can add favorite sites and a free api from NewsAPI.org to show news too.

That is all.

PS: You can't set a custom "New Tab" page in Brave, but you can:
1. Add the "Home" button
2. Which allows you to set a cutom Home page
3. Set the "New Tab" page to your home page

Which achieves the same thing. If you're not using Brave I'm sure you can figure it out. You're smart.
